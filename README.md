Part of keeping customers happy is anticipating their needs, and call center analytics can do that and more. For instance, one of the most important aspects of any customer service operation is the ability to handle a customerâ€™s needs during their first call; if a customer calls back within two weeks, there could be a possbility that the previous issue has not been resolved and that he/she is calling for the same reason.

This study aims to determine whether there exists any dependency between a previous intent and the next intent of a caller.
